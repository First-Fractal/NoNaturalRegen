# No Natural Regen
No Natural Regen is a mod that disable natural regen for everyone. Items that give you life regen still works. This mod is just for those who wants an extra challenge to there playthrough. And if this isn't enough for them, then this mod also have 3 extra config options to disable things. The first one is to disable nurse healing during a boss fight, the second is to disable the nurse to heal outright, and the third is to disable all healing potions. Credit to Shun Kim for the orginal idea.
